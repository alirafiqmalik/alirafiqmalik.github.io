Hi, I am PhD student @ University of Massachusetts Amherst. I work on quantum computers and quantum systems, focusing on security aspect with Dr. Muhammad Taqi Raza in <a href="https://khwarizmilab.github.io/" target="_blank">Khwarizmi Lab</a>.
Before joining UMass, I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) from [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/){:target="_blank"}, Pakistan in 2023.

I am engaged in the examination of quantum protocols pertaining to network communication, focusing on conducting formal analyses to uncover security vulnerabilities. My research endeavors lay the groundwork for devising efficient techniques to automate protocol analysis, ensuring the security guarantees provided by these protocols.
